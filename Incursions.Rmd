I was showing Laura Navaro's ["Evolution of genres"](https://github.com/lau-cloud/TidyTuesdaycode/tree/master/Billboard) to my muso friend and we got talking about what songs and bands might have made the incursions we see in the graphic:

* Alt Rock
* Alt Metal
* Alt Hip-Hop

This project is an exploration of these genres.

## Import the data

The CSV files are quite large so I downloaded them rather than pulling them down each time I import. They're available on the [TidyTuesday repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-09-14). 

### Billboard charts and Spotify audio features.
```{r}
billboard <- readr::read_csv("billboard.csv")
audio_features <- readr::read_csv("audio_features.csv")
```
