# billboard-100

I was showing Laura Navaro's ["Evolution of genres"](https://github.com/lau-cloud/TidyTuesdaycode/tree/master/Billboard) to a friend as an example of the fun we can have with R. There were a few genres that entered the charts briefly that we thought were interesting:

* Alt Rock
* Alt Metal
* Alt Hip-Hop

This project is an investigation into the comings and goings of these genres.

The file `Genre-Report.Rmd` contains a very rough report on the corresponding songs of the genres above.
